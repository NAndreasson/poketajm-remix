TODOs:

- [ ] Code cleanup etc... 
- [ ] Add some simple Playwright tests
- [ ] Fix better accessibility for screen readers.
- [ ] Proper fuzzy search
- [ ] Fix file upload

## What's in the stack

- Database ORM with [Prisma](https://prisma.io)
- Styling with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- End-to-end testing with [Cypress](https://cypress.io)
- Unit testing with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev) and [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com)
- Code formatting with [Prettier](https://prettier.io)
- Linting with [ESLint](https://eslint.org)
- Static Types with [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org)

## Quickstart

## Development

- Start the Postgres Database in [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started):

  ```sh
  npm run docker
  ```

  > **Note:** The npm script will complete while Docker sets up the container in the background. Ensure that Docker has finished and your container is running before proceeding.

- Initial setup:

  ```sh
  npm run setup
  ```

- Run the first build:

  ```sh
  npm run build
  ```

- Start dev server:

  ```sh
  npm run dev
  ```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

### Relevant code:

pokemon.server.ts and types.server.ts

## Testing

### Vitest

For lower level tests of utilities and individual components, we use `vitest`. We have DOM-specific assertion helpers via [`@testing-library/jest-dom`](https://testing-library.com/jest-dom).

### Type Checking

This project uses TypeScript. It's recommended to get TypeScript set up for your editor to get a really great in-editor experience with type checking and auto-complete. To run type checking across the whole project, run `npm run typecheck`.

### Linting

This project uses ESLint for linting. That is configured in `.eslintrc.js`.

### Formatting

We use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for auto-formatting in this project. It's recommended to install an editor plugin (like the [VSCode Prettier plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)) to get auto-formatting on save. There's also a `npm run format` script you can run to format all files in the project.
